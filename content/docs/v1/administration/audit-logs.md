| ------------------ | --------------- |
| No accountability for changes | Full attribution |

## Data Retention

System settings control how long audit logs are kept:

1. Go to **Settings** → **System Settings**
2. Scroll to **Data Retention**
3. Configure **System Logs** (Default: 90 days)

Events older than the retention period are automatically deleted.

---

## Security Monitoring

### Suspicious Activity Detection

OpsKnight flags potentially suspicious events implies you should monitor:
- Consecutive `LOGIN_FAILED` events
- `LOGIN_BLOCKED` events indicating rate limiting
- `session.revoked_all` events

### Active Sessions

Users can view and revoke their own sessions:
1. Go to **Settings** → **Security**
2. View **Active Sessions** table
3. Click **Revoke All** to sign out of all devices

---

## Compliance Support

Audit logs provide an immutable record of all administrative actions, supporting compliance requirements for:

- **SOC 2**: Access control and change management logging
- **GDPR**: Tracking data access and user management
- **HIPAA**: Administrative audit trails

---

## Best Practices

### Regular Review

| Frequency | Review Focus |
| --------- | ------------ |
| **Daily** | Failed logins, security events |
| **Weekly** | Permission changes, new users |
| **Monthly** | Configuration changes |
| **Quarterly** | Full audit, compliance check |

### Investigation Workflow

When investigating an issue:

1. **Identify timeframe** of suspicious activity
2. **Scroll logs** to relevant period
3. **Identify actors** involved
4. **Trace actions** chronologically
5. **Correlate events** across categories
6. **Take screenshots** for evidence
7. **Document findings**

### Retention Planning

- **Minimum**: Keep logs long enough for incident investigation (90 days)
- **Compliance**: Meet regulatory requirements
- **Storage**: Balance retention with storage costs

### Access Control

- Limit audit log access to admins
- Review who has admin access regularly
- Use SSO with MFA for admin accounts
- Log admin actions for accountability

---

## Troubleshooting

### Missing Events

1. Check that you are looking at the correct timeframe (scroll down)
2. Confirm actor has performed the actions recently
3. Check retention period settings in System Settings
4. Verify you have Admin permissions
