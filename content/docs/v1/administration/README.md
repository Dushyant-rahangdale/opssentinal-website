## Quick Setup Checklist

When setting up OpsKnight for your organization, complete these administrative tasks:

### 1. Configure Notification Channels

Without notifications, OpsKnight can't alert responders. Set up at least one channel:

| Priority | Channel | Setup Guide |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| **Essential** | Email | [SMTP/SendGrid/Resend setup](./notifications.md#email) |
| **Recommended** | Slack | [Slack OAuth integration](../integrations/slack.md) |
| **For Critical Alerts** | SMS | [Twilio/AWS SNS setup](./notifications.md#sms) |
| **For Mobile** | Push | [FCM/OneSignal setup](./notifications.md#push) |

### 2. Set Up Authentication

Choose your authentication strategy:

| Option | Best For | Setup |
|--------|----------|-------|
| **Local Auth** | Small teams, quick start | Default, no config needed |
| **Google SSO** | Google Workspace orgs | [OIDC setup](../security/oidc-setup.md) |
| **Microsoft Entra** | Microsoft 365 orgs | [OIDC setup](../security/oidc-setup.md) |
| **Okta/Auth0** | Enterprise with IdP | [OIDC setup](../security/oidc-setup.md) |

### 3. Create Teams and Invite Users

1. **Create teams** to organize responders
2. **Invite users** via email
3. **Assign roles** (User, Responder, Admin)
4. **Add users to teams** with appropriate roles

### 4. Configure Data Retention (Optional)

Set retention policies based on your compliance needs:

- **Incidents**: 2 years (default)
- **Alerts**: 1 year (default)
- **Logs**: 90 days (default)

### 5. Review Audit Logs

Understand what's being tracked:

- Login attempts
- User management changes
- Configuration changes
- Data access events

---

## Accessing Admin Settings

### Via UI

1. Click **Settings** in the sidebar
2. Sections available depend on your role:
   - **Users**: Everyone can access their profile
   - **Teams**: Team admins can manage their teams
   - **System Settings**: Admin role required

### Via API

Admin endpoints require admin API keys:

```bash
# List users (admin only)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_admin_xxx" \
  https://opsknight.yourco.com/api/users
```

---

## Admin Roles and Permissions

| Role | Capabilities |
|------|--------------|
| **User** | View incidents, acknowledge, basic profile settings |
| **Responder** | All User permissions + on-call + incident management |
| **Admin** | All permissions + system settings + user management |

### What Admins Can Do

- Configure notification providers (Email, SMS, Push)
- Set up SSO/OIDC integration
- Manage all users (invite, disable, change roles)
- Configure custom fields
- Set data retention policies
- View and export audit logs
- Configure system settings (App URL, encryption)

---

## System Health Monitoring

### Health Check Endpoint

```bash
curl https://opsknight.yourco.com/api/health
```

Response:
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "database": "connected",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

### What to Monitor

| Component | What to Check |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Database** | Connection status, query performance |
| **Job Queue** | Pending jobs, failed jobs |
| **Notifications** | Delivery success rate |
| **Integrations** | Webhook success rate |

---

## Security Considerations

### Sensitive Data

OpsKnight stores sensitive configuration that should be protected:

| Data | Storage | Protection |
|------|---------|------------|
| API keys | Database | Encrypted at rest |
| OAuth tokens | Database | Encrypted at rest |
| SMTP credentials | Database | Encrypted at rest |
| User passwords | Database | Bcrypt hashed |

### Access Control

- Use **SSO** when possible for centralized identity management
- Enable **MFA** at your identity provider
- Review **audit logs** regularly
- **Rotate API keys** periodically
- Use **least privilege** — only grant Admin role when necessary

### Data Privacy

- Configure **data retention** to meet compliance requirements
- Incidents and alerts are deleted after retention period
- **Audit logs** have separate retention (typically longer)
- Consider **GDPR/CCPA** requirements for user data

---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Notifications Not Sending

1. Check provider configuration in Settings → Notifications
2. Verify credentials are correct
3. Test with "Send Test" button
4. Check system logs for errors
5. Verify user has notifications enabled

### Users Can't Log In

1. Check user status (ACTIVE, DISABLED, INVITED)
2. For SSO: Verify OIDC configuration
3. For local auth: Check password requirements
4. Review audit logs for failed login attempts
5. Check rate limiting (lockout after failures)

### Data Not Appearing

1. Check data retention settings
2. Verify database connectivity
3. Check if data was deleted by retention policy
4. Review system logs for errors
