# API Reference

The OpsKnight API lets you programmatically manage incidents, integrate monitoring tools, query schedules, and automate your incident management workflows.

---

## API Endpoints Overview

| Endpoint | Description | Common Use Cases |
|----------|-------------|------------------|
| [Events API](./events.md) | Trigger, acknowledge, resolve incidents | Monitoring integrations |
| [Incidents API](./incidents.md) | List, create, update incidents | Custom dashboards, automation |
| Services API | Manage services | Service catalog automation |
| Schedules API | Query on-call schedules | Who's on-call integrations |
| Users API | Manage users | User provisioning |
| Teams API | Manage teams | Team automation |

---

## Authentication

All API requests require authentication. OpsKnight supports API key authentication.

### Creating an API Key

1. Go to **Settings** → **API Keys**
2. Click **Create API Key**
3. Enter a name (e.g., "Datadog Integration")
4. Select scopes (permissions)
5. Copy the key — it's only shown once!

<!-- Add: Screenshot of API key creation modal -->

### Using Your API Key

Include the API key in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
# Bearer token format (recommended)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_live_abc123..." \
  https://opsknight.yourco.com/api/incidents

# Alternative: Api-Key format
curl -H "Authorization: Api-Key sk_live_abc123..." \
  https://opsknight.yourco.com/api/incidents

# Alternative: X-API-Key header
curl -H "X-API-Key: sk_live_abc123..." \
  https://opsknight.yourco.com/api/incidents
```

### API Key Prefixes

| Prefix | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `sk_live_` | Production | Full access based on scopes |
| `sk_test_` | Test | Sandbox/test environment |

### Scopes

API keys have scoped permissions. Select only what you need:

| Scope | Description |

| `events:write` | Send events (trigger, acknowledge, resolve) |
| `incidents:read` | Read incidents and incident details |
| `incidents:write` | Create and update incidents |
| `services:read` | Read services |
| `services:write` | Create and update services |
| `schedules:read` | Read schedules and on-call |

## Base URL

All API endpoints are relative to your OpsKnight instance:

```
https://your-opsknight-instance.com/api
```

Example:
```
https://opsknight.yourco.com/api/incidents
```

---

## Request Format

### Headers

```http
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer sk_live_abc123...
```

### Request Body

JSON format for POST/PATCH requests:

```json
{
  "title": "High CPU on web-01",
  "urgency": "HIGH",
  "service_id": "svc_abc123"
}
```

---

## Response Format

### Success Response

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "inc_abc123",
    "title": "High CPU on web-01",
    "status": "OPEN",
    "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
  }
}
```

### List Response (Paginated)

```json
{
  "data": [
    { "id": "inc_abc123", "title": "..." },
    { "id": "inc_def456", "title": "..." }
  ],
  "pagination": {
    "total": 150,
    "limit": 25,
    "offset": 0,
    "has_more": true
  }
}
```

### Error Response

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "message": "Title is required",
    "details": {
      "field": "title",
      "reason": "required"
    }
  }
}
```

---

## Error Codes

| Code | HTTP Status | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `UNAUTHORIZED` | 401 | Invalid or missing API key |
| `FORBIDDEN` | 403 | API key lacks required scope |
| `NOT_FOUND` | 404 | Resource not found |
| `VALIDATION_ERROR` | 400 | Invalid request data |
| `CONFLICT` | 409 | Resource conflict (e.g., duplicate) |
| `RATE_LIMITED` | 429 | Too many requests |
| `INTERNAL_ERROR` | 500 | Server error |

---

## Rate Limits

API requests are rate limited to ensure fair usage:

| Endpoint Type | Limit | Window |
|---------------|-------|--------|
| Events API | 100 requests | per minute |
| Read endpoints | 300 requests | per minute |
| Write endpoints | 100 requests | per minute |

### Rate Limit Headers

Every response includes rate limit information:

```http
X-RateLimit-Limit: 100
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 95
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1705318800
```

### Handling Rate Limits

When rate limited, you'll receive a `429` response:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "RATE_LIMITED",
    "message": "Too many requests. Retry after 30 seconds.",
    "retry_after": 30
  }
}
```

**Best practices**:
- Implement exponential backoff
- Respect the `Retry-After` header
- Cache responses where appropriate
- Batch requests when possible

## Pagination

List endpoints support pagination:

| Parameter | Default | Max | Description |
|-----------|---------|-----|-------------|
| `limit` | 25 | 100 | Items per page |
| `offset` | 0 | - | Skip N items |

### Example

```bash
# First page
GET /api/incidents?limit=25&offset=0

# Second page
GET /api/incidents?limit=25&offset=25

# Third page

```

### Response

```json
{
  "data": [...],
  "pagination": {
    "total": 150,
    "limit": 25,
    "offset": 25,
    "has_more": true
  }
}
```

## Filtering

## Webhooks (Outbound)

OpsKnight can send webhooks to your systems when events occur.

### Supported Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `incident.triggered` | New incident created |
| `incident.acknowledged` | Incident acknowledged |
| `incident.resolved` | Incident resolved |
| `incident.escalated` | Incident escalated to next step |
| `incident.assigned` | Incident assigned/reassigned |

### Webhook Payload

```json
{
  "event": "incident.triggered",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "incident": {
    "id": "inc_abc123",
    "title": "High CPU on web-01",
    "status": "OPEN",
    "urgency": "HIGH",
    "service": {
      "id": "svc_xyz",
      "name": "Payment API"
    },
    "assignee": {
      "id": "usr_123",
      "name": "Alice Smith"
    }
  }
}
```

### Signature Verification

Webhooks include an HMAC-SHA256 signature:

```http
X-OpsKnight-Signature: sha256=abc123def456...
```

Verify by computing HMAC of the raw request body using your webhook secret.
