  "event_type": "INCIDENT_CREATED",
  "incident": {
    "id": "inc-abc123",
    "title": "High CPU usage on production servers",
    "state": "open",
    "severity": "critical",
    "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z",
    "updated_at": "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z",

}
```

## Event Mapping

| New Relic State | OpsKnight Action |
| --------------- | ---------------- |
| `open` | Trigger incident |
| `acknowledged` | Acknowledge incident |
| `resolved`, `closed` | Resolve incident |

For APM format, resolved/closed keywords in `alertType` trigger resolution.

---

## Severity Mapping

| New Relic Severity | OpsKnight Severity |
| ------------------ | ------------------ |
| `critical` | critical |
| `warning` | warning |
| `info` | info |

---

## Incident Title

The incident title is extracted based on format:

**Incident format**: `incident.title`

**Legacy format**: `alert.alert_condition_name` or `alert.message`

**APM format**: `alertTitle`

---

## Deduplication

Dedup keys are generated based on format:

- **Incident format**: `newrelic-{incident.id}`
- **Legacy format**: `newrelic-{alert.id}`
- **APM format**: `newrelic-{alertTimestamp}`

---

## Security

### Signature Verification (Optional)

You can secure the webhook with HMAC signature verification:

1. In OpsKnight, set a **Signing Secret** on the integration
2. Include header: `X-Signature: sha256=<hmac_signature>`

---

## Testing

### Using New Relic UI

1. Go to **Alerts & AI** → **Workflows**
2. Select your workflow
3. Click **Test workflow**
4. Verify incident appears in OpsKnight

### Using cURL

Send a test payload directly:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://YOUR_OPSKNIGHT_URL/api/integrations/newrelic?integrationId=YOUR_ID" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "account_id": 12345,
    "account_name": "Test Account",
    "incident": {
      "id": "test-incident-001",
      "title": "Test Alert from New Relic",
      "state": "open",
      "severity": "warning",
      "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z",
      "updated_at": "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z"
    }
  }'
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Alerts Not Appearing

1. **Check destination URL** is correct
2. **Verify integration ID** is valid
3. **Check workflow** is active and correctly configured
4. **Test destination** in New Relic settings

### Incidents Not Resolving

1. **Verify workflow** sends close notifications
2. **Check incident state** is being sent correctly

### Unknown Format Warning

If you see "unknown format" in incident details:

1. **Check payload** matches one of the supported formats
2. **Verify JSON** is valid
3. Contact support if using a new New Relic notification format
