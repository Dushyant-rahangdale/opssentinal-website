# Pingdom Integration

Receive down/up alerts from Pingdom.

## Setup

1. In OpsKnight, go to **Service -> Integrations**.
2. Add a **Pingdom** integration.
3. Copy the **Webhook URL**:
   `https://[YOUR_DOMAIN]/api/integrations/pingdom?integrationId=[ID]`

## Configuration in Pingdom

1. Go to **Settings -> Integrations**.
2. Add a new **Webhook** integration.
3. Name: OpsKnight
4. URL: Paste the OpsKnight Webhook URL.
5. Enable the webhook for your Checks.

## Check Logic

| Pingdom State | OpsKnight Action | Urgency |
| ------------- | ---------------- | ------- |
| `Down`        | Trigger          | `critical`|
| `Up` / `Resolved` | Resolve      | -       |

The integration handles both legacy and new Pingdom webhook formats.
