# Slack Integration

The Slack integration brings incident management directly into your team's workspace. Receive rich notifications, acknowledge incidents without leaving Slack, and keep everyone informed with real-time updates.

## Why Use Slack Integration

| Without Slack | With Slack |
| ------------- | ---------- |
| Check OpsKnight separately | Incidents come to you |
| Context switch to acknowledge | One-click acknowledge in Slack |
| Manual status updates | Automatic thread updates |
| Siloed incident info | Team visibility |

---

## Features

### Incident Notifications

- **Rich message format** with incident details
- **Urgency indicators** (color-coded)
- **Service information** and affected components
- **Timestamps** and duration tracking

### Interactive Actions

| Action | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| **Acknowledge** | Mark incident as acknowledged directly from Slack |
| **Resolve** | Resolve incident without leaving Slack |

### Real-Time Updates

- **Thread updates** when incident status changes
- **Escalation notifications** in the same thread
- **Resolution summary** when incident closes

### Channel Routing

- **Default channel** for all incidents
- **Per-service channels** for focused alerting
- **Per-urgency routing** (critical to one channel, low to another)

             Resolution: Restarted connection pool
```

---

## Interactive Actions

3. Thread update posted
4. Button changes to "Acknowledged ✓"

---

## User Mapping

OpsKnight maps Slack users to OpsKnight users for attribution.

### Automatic Mapping

When a Slack user takes an action:
1. OpsKnight looks up user by email
2. If found, action attributed to that user
3. If not found, action shows "via Slack"

### Ensuring Mapping Works

- Users must have **same email** in Slack and OpsKnight
- Slack profile email must be visible to apps
- OpsKnight user must be ACTIVE

---

## Slash Commands (Optional)

Add slash commands for quick actions.

### Available Commands

| Command | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| `/opsknight incidents` | List open incidents |
| `/opsknight oncall` | Who's on-call now |
| `/opsknight status` | System status summary |
| `/opsknight create` | Create manual incident |

### Setting Up Slash Commands

1. Go to Slack app settings
2. Click **Slash Commands**
3. Click **Create New Command**
4. Configure:
   - **Command**: `/opsknight`
   - **Request URL**: `https://YOUR_OPSKNIGHT_URL/api/integrations/slack/commands`
   - **Description**: OpsKnight incident management
5. Save

---

## Multiple Workspaces

Connect OpsKnight to multiple Slack workspaces.

### Adding Another Workspace

1. Go to **Settings** → **Integrations** → **Slack**
2. Click **Add Workspace**
3. Complete OAuth flow for new workspace
4. Configure channels for new workspace

### Workspace-Specific Settings

Each workspace can have:
- Different default channel
- Different notification preferences
- Different user mappings

---

## Troubleshooting

### Messages Not Sending

1. **Verify bot token** is correct
2. **Check channel exists** and bot has access
3. **Verify bot is in channel** (for private channels)
4. **Test connection** in settings
5. **Check OpsKnight logs** for errors

### Action Buttons Not Working

1. **Verify interactivity URL** is correct
2. **Check HTTPS** — Slack requires HTTPS
3. **Verify signing secret** is correct
4. **Check OpsKnight is accessible** from internet

### Wrong User Attribution

1. **Check email match** between Slack and OpsKnight
2. **Verify Slack email is visible** to apps
3. **Check user is ACTIVE** in OpsKnight

### Channel Not Appearing

1. **Public channels** appear automatically
2. **Private channels** need bot invited first
3. **Refresh channel list** in settings

### Rate Limiting

If you see rate limit errors:
- OpsKnight batches notifications automatically
- Reduce notification frequency if needed
- Check for notification loops

---

## Best Practices

### Channel Organization

| Channel | Purpose |
| ------- | ------- |
| `#incidents-critical` | HIGH urgency only |
| `#incidents-all` | All incidents |
| `#payment-oncall` | Payment team incidents |
| `#platform-alerts` | Platform team incidents |

### Reducing Noise

- **Use per-service channels** to segment alerts
- **Filter by urgency** in low-priority channels
- **Disable "note added" notifications** unless needed
- **Use threads** — updates don't spam channel

### Response Workflow

1. **Incident posted** to channel
2. **On-call sees notification**
3. **Clicks Acknowledge** in Slack
4. **Investigates** the issue
5. **Clicks Resolve** when fixed
6. **Adds resolution note** in modal

### Integration with Slack Workflows

Combine with Slack Workflow Builder:
- Auto-create incident channel for major incidents
- Notify stakeholders on HIGH urgency
- Post to status channel on resolution

---

## Security Considerations

### Signing Secret Verification

OpsKnight verifies all requests from Slack using the signing secret:
- Prevents spoofed requests
- Validates request timestamp
- Required for production

### Token Security

- **Never share tokens** in public channels
- **Rotate tokens** if compromised
- **Use environment variables** for tokens

### Channel Access

- Bot only accesses channels it's invited to
- Users can only see incidents they have access to
- Actions are attributed to authenticated users

---
