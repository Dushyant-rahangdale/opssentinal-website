# Integrations

OpsKnight integrates with your entire monitoring and observability stack, routing alerts from any tool to the right people at the right time.

<!-- placeholder:integrations-overview -->
<!-- Add: Diagram showing various monitoring tools connecting to OpsKnight -->

---

## Why Integrations Matter

Your infrastructure is monitored by many tools — APM, uptime monitoring, error tracking, CI/CD pipelines, and more. Without integration:

- Alerts are scattered across multiple dashboards
- There's no unified view of what's happening
- On-call routing is inconsistent
- Response times suffer

OpsKnight integrations solve this by:
- **Centralizing all alerts** in one place
- **Normalizing formats** so every alert looks consistent
- **Routing intelligently** based on service and urgency
- **Deduplicating** to reduce noise

## Quick Start: Connect Your First Tool

### Step 1: Choose Your Integration

1. Go to **Settings** → **Integrations**
2. Find your monitoring tool
3. Click **Add Integration**

### Step 2: Copy the Webhook URL

OpsKnight generates a unique webhook URL for each integration:

```
https://your-opsknight.com/api/integrations/datadog?key=int_abc123
```

### Step 3: Configure Your Monitoring Tool

Paste the webhook URL into your monitoring tool's notification settings.

### Step 4: Send a Test Alert

Trigger a test alert to verify the integration is working.

```

### Payload Normalization

Each integration has a custom parser that normalizes tool-specific formats:

**Datadog Alert**:
```json
{
  "title": "[Triggered] CPU High on web-01",
  "alert_type": "error",
  "tags": ["env:production", "team:platform"]
}
```

**Normalized to OpsKnight**:
```json
{
  "title": "CPU High on web-01",
  "description": "CPU usage exceeded threshold",
  "urgency": "HIGH",
  "source": "datadog",
  "dedup_key": "datadog-alert-12345"
}
```

### Deduplication

The dedup key prevents duplicate incidents from the same root cause:

1. **Same dedup key** → Updates existing incident
2. **New dedup key** → Creates new incident

This is crucial during alert storms when the same issue triggers multiple alerts.
