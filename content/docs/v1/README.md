## Why OpsKnight?

When an incident strikes, every second counts. OpsKnight ensures the right person gets notified instantly, through the right channel, with all the context they need to resolve issues fast.

**The Problem**: Alert fatigue, missed notifications, unclear ownership, and slow response times cost businesses millions in downtime and erode customer trust.

**The Solution**: OpsKnight provides a unified incident management platform that:
- Routes alerts intelligently to on-call responders
- Escalates automatically when incidents go unacknowledged
- Provides complete visibility through dashboards and analytics
- Communicates status transparently to stakeholders

## Platform Overview

OpsKnight is a complete incident management solution with six core pillars:

### 1. Incident Management
Turn noisy alerts into actionable incidents with full lifecycle tracking from trigger to resolution.

<!-- placeholder:incident-lifecycle -->

### 2. On-Call Scheduling
Build flexible rotation schedules with multiple layers, timezone support, and easy overrides.

### 3. Escalation Policies
Define multi-tier escalation chains that ensure incidents always reach someone who can help.

### 4. Multi-Channel Notifications
Reach responders through Email, SMS, Push, Slack, WhatsApp, or custom webhooks.

```

**The Flow**:
1. **Alert sources** (monitoring tools) send events to OpsKnight via webhooks
2. **Services** represent your systems and route alerts to the right escalation policy
3. **Incidents** are created and tracked through their lifecycle
4. **Escalation policies** determine who gets notified and when
5. **Schedules** tell the policy who is currently on-call
6. **Notifications** go out through configured channels until someone acknowledges
