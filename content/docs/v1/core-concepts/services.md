# Services

Services are the foundation of OpsKnight's incident management model. They represent the components of your infrastructure — APIs, databases, microservices, and applications — that can experience incidents. Every incident is linked to a service, enabling clear ownership, proper routing, and meaningful analytics.

## Why Services Matter

| Without Services | With Services |
| ---------------- | ------------- |
| Alerts are orphaned with no context | Every incident has a home |
| Unclear who owns what | Clear team ownership |
| No way to prioritize | SLA tiers guide response |
| Incidents go to everyone | Targeted escalation routing |
| No health visibility | Real-time service health dashboard |

---

## Service Directory

The Service Directory is your centralized registry of all monitored components.

### Accessing the Directory

1. Click **Services** in the sidebar
2. View the service list with health indicators
3. Use filters to find specific services

### Directory Overview

The top panel provides an immediate SITREP (Situation Report):

| Metric | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| **Total Services** | Complete count of registered services |
| **Operational** | Services with no active incidents |
| **Degraded** | Services with non-critical active incidents |
| **Critical** | Services with HIGH urgency active incidents |

<!-- Add: Screenshot of the Service Directory header with health metrics -->

---

## Service Health Status

Service health is calculated dynamically based on active incidents.

### Health States

| Status | Visual | Condition | Action |
| ------ | ------ | --------- | ------ |
| **Operational** | 🟢 Green | No active incidents | None needed |
| **Degraded** | 🟡 Yellow | Active LOW/MEDIUM incidents | Monitor closely |
| **Critical** | 🔴 Red | Active HIGH urgency incident | Immediate response |

### Health Calculation Logic

```
IF any active HIGH urgency incident → CRITICAL
ELSE IF any active incident → DEGRADED
ELSE → OPERATIONAL
```

**Notes**:
- **Snoozed** incidents don't affect health status
- **Suppressed** incidents don't affect health status
- Health updates in real-time as incidents change

### Status on Service Cards

Each service card displays:
- **Left border color** — Quick visual health indicator
- **Status badge** — Current health state
- **Incident count** — Number of active incidents
- **Region** — Deployment region (if configured)
- **SLA Tier** — Service criticality level

## Creating a Service

### Via Web UI

1. Go to **Services** in the sidebar
2. Click **Create Service**
3. Fill in the required fields:
   - **Name**: Unique, descriptive name
   - **Owner Team**: Select from existing teams
4. Configure optional fields as needed
5. Click **Create**

<!-- placeholder:create-service-form -->
<!-- Add: Screenshot of the service creation form -->

### Service Naming Best Practices

| Pattern | Example | Why |
| ------- | ------- | --- |
| **Component-based** | `payment-api`, `user-service` | Clear purpose |
| **Environment-prefixed** | `prod-payment-api` | Distinguishes environments |
| **Team-prefixed** | `platform-kafka` | Shows ownership |

**Avoid**:
- Generic names (`api`, `service`)
- Abbreviations that aren't universal (`pmt-svc`)
- Special characters (stick to letters, numbers, hyphens)

### Initial Setup Checklist

After creating a service:

- [ ] Assign escalation policy
- [ ] Set SLA tier (if applicable)
- [ ] Add integrations (monitoring tools)
- [ ] Configure Slack channel (if using Slack)
- [ ] Add runbook URL
- [ ] Link to dashboards/repositories

## Service Configuration

### Escalation Policy Assignment

Link an escalation policy to determine who gets notified:

1. Open service detail page
2. Click **Edit** or go to **Settings**
3. Select **Escalation Policy** from dropdown
4. Save changes

**What happens**:
- New incidents trigger this policy
- Existing incidents continue with their assigned policy

### SLA Tier Configuration

Set the service's SLA tier for reporting and prioritization:

| Tier | Typical Uptime | Use Case |
| ---- | -------------- | -------- |
| **Platinum** | 99.99% | Customer-facing critical systems |
| **Gold** | 99.9% | Important production services |
| **Silver** | 99.5% | Internal tools, non-critical |
| **Bronze** | 99.0% | Development, low-priority |

1. Open service settings
2. Select **SLA Tier**
3. Save

SLA tiers affect:
- SLA breach calculations
- Reporting categorization
- Prioritization suggestions

### Slack Channel Routing

Route this service's alerts to a specific Slack channel:

1. Open service settings
2. Enter **Slack Channel** name (e.g., `#payment-alerts`)
3. Save

**Behavior**:
- Incidents for this service post to this channel
- If not set, uses organization default channel

---

## Service Integrations

Services connect to monitoring tools via integrations.

### Linking an Integration

1. Open the service
2. Go to **Integrations** tab
3. Click **Add Integration**
4. Select integration type (Datadog, Prometheus, etc.)
5. Configure integration settings
6. Save

### Integration Types

| Type | Purpose |
| ---- | ------- |
| **Datadog** | Receive alerts from Datadog monitors |
| **Prometheus** | Receive alerts from Alertmanager |
| **Grafana** | Receive alerts from Grafana alerts |
| **Custom Webhook** | Generic HTTP integration |

Each integration gets a unique **routing key** that directs incoming alerts to this service.

### Multiple Integrations

A service can have multiple integrations:
- Different monitoring tools
- Different alert sources
- Test vs. production alerts

---

## Service Ownership

### Team Ownership

Every service must have an owner team:

- **Single owner** — One team per service (no shared ownership)
- **Clear accountability** — Team receives escalations
- **Team page shows services** — Team members see their services

### Transferring Ownership

To change a service's owner:

1. Open service settings
2. Change **Owner Team** dropdown
3. Save

**Considerations**:
- New team takes over future incidents
- Historical incidents retain original team context
- Ensure new team has appropriate escalation policy

### Orphaned Services

Services without valid teams (team deleted):
- Show warning indicator
- Should be reassigned immediately
- May affect incident routing

---

## Filtering & Search

### Search

Type in the search box to filter by:
- Service name
- Description text

### Team Filter

Filter services by owner team:
1. Click **Team** dropdown
2. Select one or more teams
3. View only their services

### Status Filter

Filter by health status:
- **All** — Show all services
- **Critical** — Only critical services
- **Degraded** — Only degraded services
- **Operational** — Only healthy services

### Sorting Options

| Sort | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| **Name (A-Z)** | Alphabetical order |
| **Name (Z-A)** | Reverse alphabetical |
| **Status (Health)** | Critical → Degraded → Operational |
| **Most Incidents** | Noisiest services first |
| **Recently Created** | Newest services first |

## Service Metrics

### Uptime Calculation

Uptime is calculated based on incident duration:

```
Uptime % = (Total Minutes - Incident Minutes) / Total Minutes × 100
```

**What counts as downtime**:
- Active incidents (OPEN, ACKNOWLEDGED)
- Does NOT count: SNOOZED, SUPPRESSED, RESOLVED

### MTTA (Mean Time to Acknowledge)

Average time from incident creation to acknowledgment:

```
MTTA = Sum(Ack Time - Create Time) / Count of Acknowledged Incidents
```

### MTTR (Mean Time to Resolve)

Average time from incident creation to resolution:

```
MTTR = Sum(Resolve Time - Create Time) / Count of Resolved Incidents
```

### Viewing Metrics

1. Open service detail page
2. Scroll to **Metrics** section
3. Select time range (7d, 30d, 90d)

Metrics are also available via:
- **Analytics** dashboard (filtered by service)
- **API** (`/api/services/{id}/metrics`)

## Troubleshooting

### Incidents Not Routing to Service

1. Verify integration is linked to service
2. Check integration routing key is correct
3. Verify escalation policy is assigned
4. Test with a manual incident

### Service Showing Wrong Status

1. Check for active incidents (including snoozed)
2. Verify incident urgency levels
3. Refresh the page
4. Check for stale cached data

### Can't Delete Service

1. Check for active incidents (must be resolved)
2. Verify you have admin permissions
3. Check for dependent configurations
