# Command Center Dashboard

The **Command Center** is your operational headquarters — a real-time executive summary of your organization's incident health. While individual incident pages focus on specific issues, the Dashboard reveals the big picture: systemic risks, workload bottlenecks, and patterns that are invisible when looking at single tickets.

## Why the Dashboard Matters

| Without Dashboard | With Dashboard |
| ----------------- | -------------- |
| Only see individual incidents | See the "forest fire" not just trees |
| Manual health checks | Real-time system status |
| Missed patterns | AI-powered insights |
| Scattered metrics | Unified operational view |

---

## Dashboard Layout

The Command Center is organized into distinct sections:

![Command Center Dashboard](/dashboard-command-center.png)

---

## System Status

The **System Status** badge in the top-left provides an at-a-glance health indicator for your entire organization.

### Status States

| Status | Visual | Condition |
| ------ | ------ | --------- |
| **CRITICAL** | 🔴 Red | Any active HIGH urgency incident exists |
| **DEGRADED** | 🟡 Yellow | No HIGH urgency, but active MEDIUM/LOW incidents exist |
| **OPERATIONAL** | 🟢 Green | No active incidents |

### Status Logic

```
IF (active incidents with urgency = HIGH) > 0:
    status = CRITICAL
ELSE IF (active incidents) > 0:
    status = DEGRADED
ELSE:
    status = OPERATIONAL
```

### Real-Time Updates

- Status recalculates immediately when incidents change
- Resolving the last HIGH incident downgrades from CRITICAL
- Creating a new HIGH incident upgrades to CRITICAL instantly
- No manual refresh needed

---

## Metric Cards

The four hero cards provide immediate quantification of your current operational state.

### TOTAL

| Metric | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| **Scope** | All incidents within selected time range |
| **Default Range** | Last 30 days |

### OPEN

| Metric | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| **Scope** | Incidents with status `OPEN` only |
| **Excludes** | ACKNOWLEDGED, SNOOZED, SUPPRESSED |
| **Purpose** | Shows "To-Do" pile requiring action |

### UNASSIGNED

| Metric | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| **Scope** | Incidents with no assignee |
| **Time Range** | **All time** (not filtered by range selector) |
| **Rationale** | Ensures old unassigned tickets aren't hidden |

> **Note**: A retention warning badge appears if your query exceeds the data retention limit.

### CRITICAL

| Metric | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| **Scope** | Active incidents with HIGH urgency |
| **Purpose** | Immediate attention counter |
| **Alert Level** | Most urgent issues in your organization |

### Card Interactions

## AI Smart Insights

The dashboard runs a rules engine against your live incident data to surface actionable insights. These appear as colored banners below the metrics.

### Insight Types

#### Workload Risk (Yellow Banner)

**Trigger**: `Unassigned Incidents / Total Open Incidents > 30%`

```
⚠️ Workload Risk: 25% of open incidents are unassigned
```

**What it means**: Too many issues sitting without an owner.

**Action**: Assign incidents to appropriate responders or teams.

#### Critical Spike (Red Banner)

**Trigger**: `Active HIGH Urgency Incidents >= 3`

```
🔴 Critical Spike: 3 active HIGH urgency incidents detected
```

**What it means**: Potential major outage or cascading failure.

**Action**: Assess if incidents are related; consider incident commander.

#### Root Cause Hint / Concentration (Blue Banner)

**Trigger**: Single service accounts for `>= 40%` of active incidents (minimum 3 incidents)

```
💡 Root Cause Hint: 40% of alerts are from 'API Gateway'
```

**What it means**: Dependent service may be failing, causing cascading alerts.

**Action**: Prioritize the concentrated service; may resolve multiple incidents.

#### Volume Anomaly (Blue Banner)

**Trigger**: Today's incident count > `1.5x` the 30-day daily average

```
📊 Volume Anomaly: Today's incidents are 2.1x above average
```

**What it means**: Unusual noise level; "death by 1000 cuts" scenario.

**Action**: Investigate for deployment issues, infrastructure problems, or external factors.

### Insight Priority

Insights display in priority order:
1. **Critical Spike** (most urgent)
2. **Workload Risk**
3. **Root Cause Hint**
4. **Volume Anomaly**

Maximum of 3 insights shown at once to avoid information overload.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Dashboard Not Loading

1. Check internet connection
2. Clear browser cache
3. Try incognito/private window
4. Check for browser console errors

### Metrics Seem Wrong

1. Check time range selection
2. Verify team/service filters
3. Understand what's included (e.g., UNASSIGNED is all-time)
4. Check for data retention limits

### Auto-Refresh Not Working

1. Verify toggle is enabled
2. Check if browser tab is active
3. Try disabling browser extensions
4. Check for JavaScript errors

### Insights Not Showing

1. Insights appear only when thresholds are met

---

## Best Practices

### Daily Operations

- **Start your day** with the Dashboard
- **Check System Status** before major changes
- **Review Smart Insights** for emerging patterns
- **Monitor Critical Focus** throughout the day

### Team Standups

- **Share Dashboard** on standup screen
- **Review Ops Pulse** for current workload
- **Discuss Insights** for systemic issues
- **Check Heatmap** for recent trends

### NOC/On-Call

- **Use Kiosk Mode** on wall displays
- **Enable Auto-Refresh** at 30-60 seconds
- **Monitor Critical Spike** alerts
- **Track Unassigned** to prevent backlog

### Incident Commander

- **Dashboard is your war room view**
- **System Status** shows overall impact
- **Services at Risk** identifies affected systems
- **Critical Focus** prioritizes response
