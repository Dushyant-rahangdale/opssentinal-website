# Postmortems

Postmortems (also called Post-Incident Reviews or PIRs) document what happened during an incident, why it happened, and what you'll do to prevent recurrence. OpsKnight provides a structured workflow for creating, reviewing, and tracking postmortems.

## Why Postmortems Matter

| Without Postmortems | With Postmortems |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |
| Same incidents repeat | Learn and prevent recurrence |
| Tribal knowledge | Documented institutional memory |
| Blame culture | Blameless improvement culture |
| No accountability for fixes | Tracked action items with owners |

---

## Postmortem Workflow

OpsKnight postmortems follow a structured lifecycle:

```
DRAFT → IN_REVIEW → PUBLISHED → ARCHIVED
```

### Workflow States

| Status | Description | Who Can Edit |
| ------ | ----------- | ------------ |
| **DRAFT** | Initial creation, work in progress | Author, Editors |
| **IN_REVIEW** | Ready for team review and feedback | Author, Editors, Reviewers |
| **PUBLISHED** | Finalized, visible to organization | Admins only |
| **ARCHIVED** | Historical record, no longer active | Admins only |

### State Transitions

## When to Write a Postmortem

### Required Triggers

| Condition | Rationale |
| --------- | --------- |
| **Any HIGH urgency incident** | Critical issues need documentation |
| **Customer-impacting outage** | External impact requires review |
| **Data loss or security incident** | Compliance and learning |
| **Incident duration > 1 hour** | Extended incidents have lessons |

### Recommended Triggers

| Condition | Rationale |
| --------- | --------- |
| **Recurring incident pattern** | Break the cycle |
| **Near-miss (almost critical)** | Learn before it gets worse |
| **Novel failure mode** | Document new knowledge |
| **Cross-team coordination issues** | Process improvements |

### Skip Postmortem When

- Incident was false positive
- Root cause is already well-documented
- No meaningful learnings possible
- Incident was immediately auto-resolved

---

## Creating a Postmortem

### From an Incident

1. Open a **resolved** incident
2. Click **Create Postmortem**
3. Incident data is automatically populated:
   - Title and description
   - Timeline events
   - Affected services
   - Participants

<!-- placeholder:create-postmortem-button -->
<!-- Add: Screenshot showing the Create Postmortem button on an incident -->

2. Click **Create Postmortem**
3. Link to an incident (optional)
4. Fill in the template

### Postmortem Fields

| Field | Required | Description |
| ----- | -------- | ----------- |
| **Title** | Yes | Clear, descriptive title |
| **Incident** | No | Linked incident (auto-populates data) |
| **Summary** | Yes | Executive summary of what happened |
| **Timeline** | Yes | Chronological event sequence |
| **Impact** | Yes | Business and customer impact |
| **Root Cause** | Yes | Technical explanation of failure |
| **Resolution** | Yes | How the incident was resolved |

---

## Postmortem Sections

### Summary

A brief executive summary (2-3 sentences) answering:
- What happened?
- What was the impact?
- How was it resolved?

**Example**:
> On January 15, 2024, the Payment API experienced a 45-minute outage due to a database connection pool exhaustion. Approximately 2,300 transactions failed during the incident. Service was restored by increasing connection pool limits and restarting affected pods.

### Timeline

Chronological sequence of events with timestamps.

| Time | Event |
| ---- | ----- |
| 14:00 | Monitoring alert triggered for elevated API latency |
| 14:03 | On-call engineer acknowledged alert |
| 14:08 | Initial investigation started, high DB connection count noted |
| 14:15 | Root cause identified: connection pool exhausted |
| 14:22 | Mitigation applied: increased pool size |
| 14:30 | Service restored, monitoring confirmed |
| 14:45 | Incident resolved, follow-up tasks created |

**Timeline Best Practices**:
- Use consistent timezone (UTC recommended)
- Include who performed each action
- Note key decisions and why they were made
- Include any false starts or dead ends

### Impact

Quantify the business and customer impact.

| Impact Type | Measurement |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| **Duration** | 45 minutes |
| **Affected Users** | ~2,300 customers |
| **Failed Transactions** | 2,347 |
| **Revenue Impact** | $12,500 estimated |
| **SLA Breach** | Yes, 99.9% target missed |
| **Support Tickets** | 47 tickets opened |

### Root Cause

Technical explanation of why the incident occurred.

**Structure**:
1. **What failed**: The specific component or system
2. **Why it failed**: The technical reason
3. **Why wasn't it caught**: Detection gaps

**Example**:
> The database connection pool was configured with a maximum of 50 connections, inherited from initial deployment 2 years ago. Recent traffic growth increased average concurrent connections from 30 to 48. A traffic spike from a marketing campaign pushed connections over the limit, causing new requests to queue and timeout.
>
> The connection pool metrics were not monitored, so the gradual increase went unnoticed until the hard failure.

### Resolution

Steps taken to restore service.

| Step | Action | Result |
| ---- | ------ | ------ |
| 1 | Increased connection pool to 100 | Pending connections processed |
| 2 | Restarted 3 affected API pods | Fresh connection pools |
| 3 | Verified transaction processing | Normal throughput resumed |
| 4 | Monitored for 15 minutes | No recurrence |

### Action Items

Tracked tasks to prevent recurrence.

| Action | Owner | Due Date | Priority | Status |
| ------ | ----- | -------- | -------- | ------ |
| Add connection pool monitoring | @jane | Jan 22 | HIGH | Open |
| Set up alerts at 80% pool usage | @jane | Jan 22 | HIGH | Open |
| Review all DB connection configs | @bob | Jan 29 | MEDIUM | Open |
| Document connection pool sizing | @alice | Feb 5 | LOW | Open |

### Lessons Learned

Key takeaways for the team.

**What went well**:
- Alert fired within 3 minutes of issue
- On-call responded quickly
- Root cause identified in 12 minutes

**What could be improved**:
- No monitoring on connection pool utilization
- Initial config was never revisited as traffic grew
- Runbook didn't cover connection pool issues

**Where we got lucky**:
- Traffic spike was moderate; larger spike would have been worse
- Database itself remained healthy

## Best Practices

### Blameless Culture

| Do | Don't |
| -- | ----- |
| Focus on systems and processes | Blame individuals |
| Ask "what" and "how" | Ask "who" |
| Assume good intentions | Assume negligence |
| Treat failures as learning | Treat failures as punishment |

### Writing Quality

- **Be specific**: Include exact times, metrics, commands
- **Be factual**: Document what happened, not opinions
- **Be complete**: Don't skip uncomfortable details
- **Be constructive**: Every problem needs an action item

### Timing

| Phase | Target |
| ----- | ------ |
| Draft started | Within 24 hours of resolution |
| Draft completed | Within 48 hours |
| Review completed | Within 1 week |
| Published | Within 2 weeks |

### Action Items

- Make them **specific** and **measurable**
- Assign **one owner** (not a team)
- Set **realistic due dates**
- **Track to completion** (don't let items rot)
- **Link to tickets** in your issue tracker
