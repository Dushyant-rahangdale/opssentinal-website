# Authentication and Security

OpsKnight implements defense-in-depth to protect authentication flows, sessions, and sensitive data.

## Security Controls

| Risk                              | Protection                         | Notes |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ----- |
| Brute force                       | Rate limiting + lockouts           | Progressive lockouts after failures |
| User enumeration                  | Uniform responses                   | Same response for valid/invalid users |
| Session hijacking                 | Token versioning                    | Invalidates old sessions immediately |
| Timing attacks                    | Constant-time responses             | Prevents side-channel leaks |
| Privilege abuse                   | Audit logging + admin controls      | Sensitive actions logged |

## Rate Limiting

Login attempts are tracked by email + IP.
