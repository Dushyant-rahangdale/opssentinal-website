# Technical Architecture

OpsKnight is designed as a **cloud-native, event-driven platform** built on the Next.js App Router. It separates the **Control Plane** (User Interaction & API) from the **Worker Plane** (Reliability & Async Processing) to ensure high availability and zero-data-loss for critical alerts.

## High-Level System Architecture

The following diagram details the **System Logic Flow**, mapping exactly how data moves through the ingestion pipeline, the database, and the asynchronous reliability engine.

## Core Subsystems

### 1. Ingestion Pipeline (The "Funnel")
The entry point for all chaos.
*   **Normalization**: The `API` layer accepts generic webhooks or provider-specific payloads (Datadog, Prometheus). It normalizes them into a standard `GenericEvent` schema.
*   **Deduplication**: Before persisting, the engine checks for existing open incidents with the same `dedup_key` to prevent alert storms.
*   **Enrichment**: Metadata is added (Service ownership, tagging) before the incident is written to Postgres.

### 2. Background Processing (Cron)
We use **node-cron** for reliable background task scheduling within the main application instance.
*   **Mechanism**: A scheduled task runner initializes on server startup (`server.ts`).
*   **Core Responsibilities**:
    -   **Escalation Processing**: Polls every minute for incidents requiring escalation steps.
    -   **SLA Monitoring**: Checks for SLA breaches and updates status snapshots.
    -   **Data Retention**: Specific jobs (like `data-cleanup.ts`) handle pruning of old logs and metrics.
*   **Reliability**:
    -   **Atomic Operations**: Uses Prisma transactions to ensure data consistency during processing.
    -   **Idempotency**: Jobs are designed to be safe to run multiple times (skip if already processed).

### 3. The PWA (Client)
The frontend is a **Progressive Web App** built with Next.js App Router.
*   **Optimistic UI**: Use of `useOptimistic` hooks ensures the UI feels instant (e.g., when clicking "Acknowledge"), while the server processes the request in the background.
*   **Service Workers**: Handles `web-push` events to wake up the potential responder even if the browser tab is closed.
*   **Data Fetching**: Hybrid approach using Server Components for initial load and efficient client-side polling/revalidation for live updates.

### 4. Security & Compliance
*   **Authentication**: Managed via `NextAuth.js`, supporting generic OIDC and Email Magic Links.
*   **RBAC**: Role-Based Access Control checks are enforced at the API Handler level.
*   **Audit Trails**: Every state change is written to an immutable `IncidentEvent` ledger.
