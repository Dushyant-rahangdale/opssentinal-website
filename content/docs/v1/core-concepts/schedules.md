# On-Call Schedules

On-call schedules define who is responsible for responding to incidents during specific time periods. They're the backbone of reliable incident response, ensuring there's always someone available to help.

## Why Schedules Matter

Without schedules, you'd have to manually assign every incident or broadcast alerts to everyone (causing alert fatigue). Schedules solve this by:

- **Automatic routing** — Escalation policies use schedules to find the right person
- **Fair distribution** — Rotate on-call duty fairly among team members
- **Clear ownership** — Everyone knows who's responsible at any given time
- **Flexibility** — Handle vacations, sick days, and coverage swaps easily

---

## Key Concepts

### Schedule

A schedule is a container that defines on-call coverage for a specific purpose (e.g., "Payment API Primary On-Call"). Each schedule has:

- **Name** — Descriptive identifier
- **Timezone** — All times are interpreted in this timezone
- **Layers** — One or more rotation patterns

### Layer

A layer represents a rotation pattern within a schedule. Schedules can have multiple layers for complex coverage scenarios.

**Why multiple layers?**
- **Primary/Secondary** — Different responders for initial vs. backup
- **Business hours/After hours** — Different coverage by time of day
- **Holiday coverage** — Special rotations for holidays

**Layer precedence**: Higher layers override lower layers. If Layer 2 has someone on-call, they take precedence over Layer 1.

### Rotation

A rotation defines how users cycle through on-call duty within a layer:

- **Rotation Length** — How long each person is on-call (24h, 168h, etc.)
- **Rotation Order** — The sequence of users in the rotation

### Override

An override is a temporary change to the normal rotation, used for:

- **Vacation coverage** — Someone else takes over during PTO
- **Shift swaps** — Trading on-call with a teammate
- **Emergency coverage** — Filling gaps when someone is unavailable

## Creating a Schedule

### Step 1: Navigate to Schedules
1. Click **Schedules** in the sidebar

### Step 2: Create New Schedule
1. Click **Create Schedule**
2. Enter schedule details:
   - **Name**: `Platform Team Primary`
   - **Timezone**: `America/New_York` (or your team's timezone)
3. Click **Create**

<!-- placeholder:create-schedule -->
![Create schedule](/schedule-create.png)

### Step 3: Add a Layer
1. Click **Add Layer**
2. Configure layer settings:
   - **Name**: `Weekly Rotation`
   - **Rotation Length**: `168 hours` (1 week)
   - **Start Time**: When the rotation should begin

### Step 4: Add Users
1. Click **Add User** in the layer
2. Select team members in rotation order
3. Drag to reorder if needed

**Result**: Users rotate through on-call duty based on the rotation length.

## Rotation Types

### Daily Rotation (24 hours)

Each person is on-call for one day:

```
Monday:    Alice
Tuesday:   Bob
Wednesday: Charlie
Thursday:  Alice
Friday:    Bob
Saturday:  Charlie
Sunday:    Alice
```

**Best for**: Teams that want to limit on-call burden to one day at a time.

### Weekly Rotation (168 hours)

Each person is on-call for one week:

```
Week 1: Alice
Week 2: Bob
Week 3: Charlie
Week 4: Alice
...
```

**Best for**: Most teams — provides continuity without too much context switching.

### Custom Rotation

Set any rotation length in hours for specific needs:

- **12 hours** — Split day/night shifts
- **48 hours** — Two-day on-call periods
- **336 hours** — Bi-weekly rotation

---

## Schedule Layers

Layers are powerful tools for building complex coverage patterns.

### How Layers Work

Think of layers as transparent overlays. Higher layers "cover" lower layers:

```
       ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
Layer 2│   │   Bob (Override)   │               │ ← Higher priority
       └─────────────────────────────────────────┘
       ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
Layer 1│ Alice │ Alice │ Alice │ Alice │ Alice │ ← Base rotation
       └─────────────────────────────────────────┘
        Mon    Tue    Wed    Thu    Fri

Result:  Alice  Bob    Bob    Alice  Alice
```

### Example: Primary + Secondary

**Layer 1 (Primary)**:
- Weekly rotation: Alice → Bob → Charlie

**Layer 2 (Secondary)**:
- Weekly rotation: Bob → Charlie → Alice

When escalation looks for "Primary On-Call," it gets Layer 1.
When escalation looks for "Secondary On-Call," it gets Layer 2.

### Example: Business Hours Override

**Layer 1 (24x7 Coverage)**:
- Weekly rotation among night team

**Layer 2 (Business Hours Only)**:
- Time window: 9am - 6pm
- Daily rotation among day team

During business hours, Layer 2 takes over. Outside business hours, Layer 1 is active.

### Example: Holiday Coverage

**Layer 1 (Normal Rotation)**:
- Standard weekly rotation

**Layer 2 (Holiday)**:
- Time window: Dec 24 - Jan 1
- Special rotation: Volunteers who signed up for holiday coverage

## Overrides

Overrides let you make temporary changes without modifying the base rotation.

### Creating an Override

1. Open the schedule
2. Click on the timeline where you want the override
3. Select **Create Override**
4. Configure:
   - **Start/End Time**: When the override is active
   - **User**: Who will be on-call instead
   - **Replaces** (optional): Whose shift is being covered

<!-- placeholder:create-override -->
![Create override](/schedule-override.png)

### Common Override Scenarios

#### Vacation Coverage
Alice is on vacation next week. Bob agrees to cover:

```yaml
Override:
  Start: Monday 9am
  End: Sunday 11:59pm
  User: Bob
  Replaces: Alice
```

#### Shift Swap
Charlie wants to swap Tuesday with Diana:

```yaml
Override 1:
  Start: Tuesday 12am
  End: Tuesday 11:59pm
  User: Diana
  Replaces: Charlie

Override 2:
  Start: Thursday 12am
  End: Thursday 11:59pm
  User: Charlie
  Replaces: Diana
```

#### Emergency Gap Coverage
The scheduled person is suddenly unavailable:

```yaml
Override:
  Start: Now
  End: Tomorrow 9am
  User: Team Lead
  Replaces: Original person
```

### Viewing Overrides

- **Calendar View**: Overrides appear as highlighted blocks
- **Override List**: View all active and upcoming overrides
- **Filter**: Show only your overrides or all team overrides

## Timezone Handling

Schedules are **timezone-authoritative**. This means:

1. All times in the schedule are in the schedule's timezone
2. When you view the schedule, times are shown in the schedule's timezone
3. On-call lookups use the schedule's timezone

### Example

Schedule: `Platform Team On-Call`
Timezone: `America/New_York` (EST/EDT)

If the rotation starts at "9am Monday":
- This means 9am Eastern Time
- NOT 9am in the viewer's local timezone

### Working with Global Teams

For follow-the-sun coverage, you have two options:

**Option 1: One schedule, multiple layers**
```
Schedule: Global On-Call (UTC)
  Layer 1: APAC team (active 9am-5pm JST = 0am-8am UTC)
  Layer 2: EU team (active 9am-5pm CET = 8am-4pm UTC)
  Layer 3: US team (active 9am-5pm EST = 2pm-10pm UTC)
```

**Option 2: Separate schedules per region**
```
Schedule: APAC On-Call (Asia/Tokyo)
Schedule: EU On-Call (Europe/London)
Schedule: US On-Call (America/New_York)
```

Both work — choose based on your escalation policy needs.

## Who's On-Call Now?

### Via UI

1. Open the **Schedules** page
2. Each schedule shows the current on-call person
3. Click a schedule to see the full calendar

---

## Connecting Schedules to Escalation Policies

Schedules become useful when connected to escalation policies:

### In Escalation Policy Builder

1. Add a step
2. Set **Target Type**: `Schedule`
3. Select your schedule
4. Set delay (usually 0 for first step)

### What Happens at Escalation Time

1. Escalation engine queries the schedule
2. Schedule returns the current on-call user
3. That user receives notifications
4. If no ack, escalation continues to next step

## Best Practices

### For Rotation Design

- **Avoid single-person schedules** — Always have backup coverage
- **Keep rotation length reasonable** — Weekly is a good default
- **Document handoff procedures** — Clear context transfer
- **Balance workload** — Fair distribution among team members

### For Overrides

- **Create overrides proactively** — Don't wait until the last minute
- **Use "Replaces" field** — Makes tracking easier
- **Review upcoming overrides** — Avoid gaps in coverage
- **Set calendar reminders** — For coverage you've agreed to provide

### For Global Teams

- **Choose a reference timezone** — UTC or your HQ timezone
- **Document timezone expectations** — Clear communication
- **Test coverage across timezones** — Verify no gaps
- **Consider on-call fatigue** — Fair distribution across regions

## Troubleshooting

### "No one on-call" Error

**Cause**: Gap in coverage at the queried time

**Fix**:
1. Check layer configurations for gaps
2. Verify rotation start times
3. Add users to layers
4. Create overrides to fill gaps

### Wrong Person Notified

**Cause**: Override or layer precedence issue

**Fix**:
1. Check active overrides
2. Review layer priority (higher layers win)
3. Verify timezone settings

### Schedule Shows Different Time Than Expected

**Cause**: Timezone mismatch

**Fix**:
1. Verify schedule timezone setting
2. Remember times display in schedule timezone, not your local time
3. Adjust layer time windows if needed
