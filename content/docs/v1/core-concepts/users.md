# Users

Users are the people who interact with OpsKnight — from responders handling incidents to administrators managing the platform. This guide covers user management, roles, permissions, and personal settings.

## Why User Management Matters

| Without Proper User Management | With Proper User Management |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| Everyone has full access | Role-based access control |
| No accountability | Clear audit trail |
| Alert fatigue for all | Targeted notifications |
| Manual onboarding | Streamlined invite flow |
