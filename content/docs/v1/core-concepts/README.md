# Core Concepts

Understanding OpsKnight's core concepts is essential for building an effective incident management workflow. This section explains how each component works, why it exists, and how they connect to form a complete system.

<!-- placeholder:core-concepts-overview -->
<!-- Add: Visual diagram showing how all concepts interconnect -->

## The Big Picture

OpsKnight is built around a simple but powerful model: **Alerts become Incidents, Incidents trigger Escalations, Escalations notify People**.

## How Concepts Connect

### The Alert-to-Resolution Flow

1. **Alert Received**: A monitoring tool sends a webhook to OpsKnight
2. **Service Identified**: The routing key maps the alert to a Service
3. **Incident Created**: OpsKnight creates an Incident with deduplication
4. **Escalation Started**: The Service's Escalation Policy is triggered
5. **On-Call Found**: The Schedule determines who is currently on-call
6. **Notification Sent**: The on-call person receives alerts via configured channels
7. **Acknowledge**: The responder acknowledges, stopping further escalation
8. **Resolve**: The incident is fixed and marked resolved

### Key Relationships

```

    └── uses ────▶ Escalation Policy

                          ├── Step 1 ──▶ Schedule ──▶ User (on-call)
                          ├── Step 2 ──▶ User (backup)

## Terminology Quick Reference

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Alert** | Raw event from a monitoring tool (webhook payload) |
| **Incident** | Actionable work item created from one or more alerts |
| **Dedup Key** | Identifier to group related alerts into one incident |
| **Urgency** | Impact level: HIGH, MEDIUM, or LOW |
| **Priority** | Business priority: P1-P5 (most to least critical) |
| **Escalation** | Process of notifying additional people over time |
| **On-Call** | The person currently responsible for responding |
| **Shift** | A time period when someone is on-call |
| **Layer** | A rotation pattern within a schedule |
| **Override** | Temporary change to normal on-call assignment |
| **MTTA** | Mean Time To Acknowledge |
| **MTTR** | Mean Time To Resolve |
| **SLA** | Service Level Agreement (target response times) |

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Simple Team Setup

For small teams with straightforward needs:

```
1 Service → 1 Escalation Policy → 1 Schedule (weekly rotation)
```

### Pattern 2: Primary/Secondary Coverage

For better redundancy:

```
1 Service → 1 Escalation Policy:
    Step 1: Primary Schedule (immediate)
    Step 2: Secondary Schedule (5 min delay)
    Step 3: Manager (10 min delay)
```

### Pattern 3: Follow-the-Sun

For global teams:

```
1 Service → 1 Escalation Policy:
    Step 1: Schedule (auto-selects based on timezone)
        Layer 1: US Team (9am-5pm PT)
        Layer 2: EU Team (9am-5pm CET)
        Layer 3: APAC Team (9am-5pm JST)
```
