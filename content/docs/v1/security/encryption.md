# Encryption System User Guide

OpsSentinel encrypts sensitive secrets (SSO client secrets, Slack tokens, API keys) using a zero-trust approach.

## Overview

- Secrets are encrypted before being stored.
- Encryption keys must be backed up securely.
- Rotation re-encrypts data with a new key.

## First-Time Setup

When you first access **System Settings**, the Encryption Key will be unconfigured.

1. Click **Generate** to create a secure 32-byte (64 char) hex key.
2. Copy the key and store it in a password manager.
3. Confirm you have saved the key.
4. Click **Save Encryption Key**.

> **Important:** The system will refuse to save if you do not confirm backup.

## Key Rotation

Rotate keys on a regular schedule (e.g., every 90 days):

1. Click **Replace Key**.
2. Generate or paste the new key.
3. Ensure **Safe Key Rotation** is enabled.
4. Click **Save Encryption Key**.

### What Happens During Rotation

1. Decrypt data with the current key.
2. Re-encrypt data with the new key.
3. Update the verification canary.

> **Note:** If decryption fails, the rotation aborts and the old key remains active.

## Emergency Recovery

If the system enters **Emergency Recovery Mode**, the stored key does not match encrypted data.

1. Retrieve the original key from your password manager.
2. Paste it into the input field.
3. Click **Save Encryption Key**.

If the key matches, the system unlocks immediately.

## FAQ

**Q: What if I lost my key?**
A: Lost keys mean encrypted data cannot be recovered. You must set a new key and re-enter secrets.

**Q: Can I use `process.env.ENCRYPTION_KEY`?**
A: Yes, but it is a fallback. The key saved in System Settings takes priority.

**Q: Can I rotate without the current key?**
A: No. Rotation requires access to the current key to decrypt existing secrets.
